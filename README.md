[Expressif](http://expressif.org) is a PHP-based CMS allowing anyone to create a website without any programming language required.

## Installation

Expressif can be downloaded directly from the [official website](http://expressif.org). The downloaded file is to be sent to a server using any FTP client. Once executed, the user is redirected to a detailed step by step installer that will allow to connect the CMS to a database.

## Contributing

Expressif is built on top of a modular architecture allowing programmers to fully customize the CMS by adding new plugins and themes. A complete [documentation](http://expressif.net/zirkon/docs/index.html) detailing all the classes and methods written is available.
You can also contribute to Expressif by adding more translations. The CMS is currently available in french and english.
